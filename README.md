# Roulette

This project is a roulette application built using Angular and Pixi.js.

## Pixi.js Integration

The project uses **Pixi.js** for rendering the roulette wheel and animations. Ensure all Pixi.js assets are available in the `assets/` folder before running the application.

### Key Pixi.js Features:

- Roulette wheel and arrow are rendered as `PIXI.Sprite` and `PIXI.Graphics`.
- Spinning animation uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth motion.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or later)
- **npm** (version 7 or later)


## Development server

- **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

- Navigate to the project directory
  `cd roulette`

- Install dependencies `npm install`

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
